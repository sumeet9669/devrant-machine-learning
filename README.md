Community for those from devRant who want to learn machine learning.

So what exactly is machine learning ?

Machine learning can refer to:

the branch of artificial intelligence;
the methods used in this field (there are a variety of different approaches).
Overall, if talking about the latter, Tom Mitchell, author of the well-known book “Machine learning”, defines ML as “improving performance in some task with experience”. However, this definition is quite a broad one, so we can quote another more specific description stating that ML deals with systems that can learn from data.

ML works with data and processes it to discover patterns that can be later used to analyse new data. ML usually relies on specific representation of data, a set of “features” that are understandable for a computer. For example, if we are talking about text it should be represented through the words it contains or some other characteristics such as length of the text, number of emotional words etc. This presentation depends on the task you are dealing with and is typically referred to as “feature extraction”.
